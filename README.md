##**Sentiment Analysis with NLP and Machine Learning**
This project performs sentiment analysis on textual data using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models. It includes text preprocessing, spell correction, tokenization, lemmatization, and word embedding using GloVe embeddings.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning text, removing stopwords, and handling special characters
Spell Correction: Using SymSpell for better text normalization
Tokenization & Lemmatization: Using NLTK for better word representation
Word Embeddings: Loading GloVe 100D embeddings to convert text into vectors
Visualization: Text length distribution and unique character analysis using Matplotlib & Seaborn
Machine Learning Model: Support Vector Machine (SVM) for sentiment classification
